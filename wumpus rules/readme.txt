The Program has two files:

1)check_true_false.py:
	This file reads all the input files that is wumpus_rules, addition knowledge base file and the statement and checks if all the statements are valid and is present in the specified format. 
2)logical_expression.py:
	This files implements the tt enatils algorithm from the textbook.  It includes function for reading the symbols,reading the subexpressions, reading connectives generating the models
	The tt entails algorithm uses following functions: tt_check_all,pl_true,evalStatements,getConstants.
	
	
How to excute the code:
	
	python check_true_false.py [wampus_rules] [additional_knowledge_file] [statement_file] 
    	for example :python check_true_false.py wumpus_rules.txt additional_knowledge.txt statement.txt
